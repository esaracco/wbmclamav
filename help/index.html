<header>ClamAV Antivirus management</header>

<p>wbmclamav can be used to update ClamAV / Freshclam configuration, manage quarantine, search in the viruses database and keep it up-to-date, scan local directories, control remote ClamAV, extract signatures from new viruses, and so on.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.clamav.net">ClamAV Antivirus</a> protects you from most viruses (worms, Trojan horses, polymorphics etc). Used in conjunction with content scanners like <a href="https://www.amavis.org">amavisd-new</a>, <a href="httpis://www.mailscanner.info">MailScanner</a>, <a href="http://qmail-scanner.sourceforge.net/">Qmail-Scanner</a> or ClamAV-Milter, it moves infected E-Mails in quarantine. Its signatures database must be updated pretty often (this base contains identification strings of almost every known viruses).</p>
