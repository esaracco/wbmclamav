<header>Quarantine</header>

<p>When an infected E-Mail is detected, it is moved in a quarantine repository. This allows you search this repoitory and check every suspected E-Mail. You can also delete it, or resend it if it was mistakenly put in quarantine.</p>

<p>If you are using amavisd-new/SpamAssassin you will be able to manage both Spams and Viruses. Note that if you use ClamAV-Milter, Qmail-Scanner or MailScanner you will not be able to view the virus name in the quarantine listing.</p>

<p>You may also manually purge the quarantine directory or choose the frequency of the automatic purge.</p>
