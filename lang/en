BACKUP_RESTORE_DESCRIPTION=<p>To manage ClamAV, this module need to deactivate other system specific ClamAV control scripts and configuration. Nothing will be removed from your system. Scripts will just be moved in the directory you have indicated in the module configuration. To backup files, click on the "Backup" button. To restore files, just click on the "Restore" button.<p>You can access to this section at any moment, using the "Backup / Restore" icon on the main module page. All files wile be automatically restored when you will uninstall this module from Webmin.</p>
BACKUP_RESTORE_INFO=IMPORTANT: After a backup, go to the <a href="updates_main.cgi">Database</a> section, review the configuration and save it again.
BAD_CONFIG_1=The module's configuration parameters are wrong: they specify the use of freshclam as a daemon for automatic updates, but no freshclam daemon exists on the system.
BAD_CONFIG_2=The module's configuration parameters are wrong: they specify the use of freshclam as a daemon for automatic updates, but cron is already configured for the same task. To be able to use a daemon, you must go back to the module's configuration page, select the cron automatic update method, and come back to this page to deactivate automatic updates. You will then be able to modify the configuration again to use a daemon instead of cron.
BAD_CONFIG_3=The module's configuration parameters are wrong: they specify the use of cron for automatic updates, but a freshclam daemon is already active. To be able to use cron, you must return to the module's configuration, select a daemon automatic update method, and come back to this page to deactivate automatic updates. You will then be able to modify the configuration again to use cron instead of the daemon.
BAD_CONFIG_4=The module's configuration parameters are wrong: they specify manual update, but cron is already configured for this task. To be able to do only manual updates, you must go back to the module's configuration page, select the cron automatic update method, and come back to this page to deactivate automatic updates. You will then be able to modify the configuration again and choose manual update.
BAD_CONFIG_5=The module's configuration parameters are wrong: they specify manual update, but a freshclam daemon is already active. To be able to do only manual updates, you must return to the module's configuration, select a daemon automatic update method, and come back to this page to deactivate automatic updates. You will then be able to modify the configuration again and choose manual update.
BAD_CONFIG_6=Your system already has its own signatures database update management script (see <code>/etc/cron.daily/clamav-data</code> for details).
